# simpleNeural

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kevchn/simpleNeural.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kevchn/simpleNeural)

This is a simple Haskell Neural Network implementation (without using outside Haskell machine learning libraries).

NOTES:
- Use stack build / stack install to install simple-neural example for MNIST
- You must run simple-neural in the src/ folder because local paths for the data/ folder are hard coded in the example
